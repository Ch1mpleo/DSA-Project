# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

This repository houses a collection of implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms, ranging from fundamental structures like Linked Lists to more complex ones like Graphs. Each implementation aims to be clear, concise, and well-documented to aid understanding and learning.

## Table of Contents

* **Linked Lists**
    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
    * Circular Linked List
* **Stacks and Queues**
    * Stack (Array-based and Linked List-based)
    * Queue (Array-based and Linked List-based)
    * Priority Queue
* **Trees**
    * Binary Search Tree (BST)
    * AVL Tree
    * Heap (Min-Heap and Max-Heap)
    * Trie
* **Graphs**
    * Adjacency List Representation
    * Adjacency Matrix Representation
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)
    * Dijkstra's Algorithm
    * Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's)

## How to Use
